        <p> [1] We analyzed data between 2010 and 2014 in order to discover trends.
        The data for the export is an average of the time period since the number differ only slightly and the top 10 export countries remain the same.</p>
        <p>[2] The data we retrieved for the import is from 2014 only. Overlooking the entire time span we realized that the data is very dependent form the actual political situation in the world. Therefore we found it more representative to work with the data from 2014.
        <p>[3] for the comparison of admitted refugee and export value of the top 10 export countries we translated the numbers into AK47 (kalashnikovs). We took the kalashnikov as it is the most used firearms due to its robustness. We evaluated the price of 500$ for the
        AK47s based on its price in the US (since the US exports the most). The prices differ much depending on country and current conflicts.
